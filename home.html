                    <p><strong>Minute Burger</strong> as a brand is more than just the logo. For the last 30 years, we’ve stood by our belief of always providing our customers with <em>affordable</em> and <em>quality products</em>, which are served in clean and well-made stores. Our innovation is spearheaded by our product development teams and engineering teams who make sure that our products and our stores are always updated and ahead of the curve.</p>
                    <p>
                        For over 30 years, our stores have been serving customers with delicious and affordable products.

                        We built simplicity and efficiency into our ordering and delivery system. We have a dedicated team of highly qualified manufacturing, quality and logistics personnel who take care of producing and delivering our products to your store so that you don’t have to. Our nationwide delivery system has commissaries and warehouses strategically located across the country. It allows us to deliver patties and freshly baked bread to our stores three times a week. Near-daily deliveries to our franchisee’s stores allows them to carry only the freshest products to serve to our customers.

                        We're firm believers in technology and automation and we’ve integrated this into every step of the process. It’s this effective mix of team and technology that allows us to deliver stocks to our network within 12 to 16 hours of placing the orders (if the order is placed within the ordering window).

                        In 1982, a young couple named Juan and Maria started a small burger shop in the heart of Manila. They had a passion for cooking and wanted to share their love for burgers with the world. They started with just a few simple recipes and quickly gained a following. People loved their burgers so much that they started lining up outside the shop every day.

                        As their popularity grew, Juan and Maria decided to expand their menu. They added new items like fries, onion rings, and milkshakes. They also started experimenting with new burger recipes, like the famous "Minute Burger" and "Cheeseburger."</p>
                        <p>
                        By the mid-1990s, Minute Burger had become a household name in the Philippines. They had opened up locations all across the country and even had a few international locations. People loved their burgers so much that they started calling them "the best burgers in the Philippines."

                        Today, Minute Burger is still going strong. They've continued to innovate and experiment with new recipes over the years, but they've never lost sight of what made them successful in the first place: their passion for cooking and their love of burgers.
