            <p>At our first meeting, we talked about what our will website would be. So we brainstormed what will be the format of our website: how many pages will it have, and what will be the details our website will have (informations, designs, interactions).</p>

            <p>We started to work for our website. Relying on the mock-ups that we made during our first meeting, we first made the layout of our website and also the design. After the meeting, we continued to work on our website by ourselves as what was assigned to each other (html, css, javascript, info gathering).</p>

            <h2>Third Meeting</h2>

            <p>Our third and last meeting has focused on refining our website and also editing the video for our vlog. We have finished most of what is in the website and it only took few days for our website to be completed.</p>
